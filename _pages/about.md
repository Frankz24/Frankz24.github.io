Hi! I am a senior undergraduate majoring in mathematics and economics at Stanford. I am also pursuing a coterminal degree in computer science. I am grateful to be advised by Prof. Daniel Bump, Prof. Han Hong, and Prof. Jiajun Wu. I spent my last two summers working as a research intern at Stanford's CURIS program, under the guidance of Prof. Stefano Ermon and Prof. Jiajun Wu. 

My research interests broadly lie in <b>generative models in computer vision</b>, <b>offline reinforcement learning</b>, and <b>machine learning approaches that tackle real-world problems</b>.
