Hi! I am a senior undergraduate majoring in <b>mathematics</b> and <b>economics</b> at Stanford. I am also pursuing a coterminal degree in <b>computer science</b>. I am grateful to be advised by <b>Prof. Daniel Bump</b>, <b>Prof. Han Hong</b>, and <b>Prof. Jiajun Wu</b>. I spent my last two summers working as a research intern at Stanford's CURIS Summer CS Research Program, under the guidance of <b>Prof. Stefano Ermon</b> and <b>Prof. Jiajun Wu</b>. 

My research interests broadly lie in:
<ul>
  <li><b>Generative models in computer vision</b></li>
  <li><b>Offline reinforcement learning</b></li>
  <li><b>Machine learning approaches that tackle real-world problems</b></li>
</ul>
