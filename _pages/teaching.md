I have previous tutored <b>number theory</b>, <b>abstract algebra</b>, and <b>proof-writing</b> at the introductory level. I have also volunteered my time to teach <b>English</b> to primary school students in poor areas of Guangxi China and an orphanage in Thailand, helping them to overcome the barriers to higher education. 

I am actively tutoring high-school students the <b>International Baccalaureate high-level Mathematics</b> curriculum.
